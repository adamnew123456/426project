                    <h1>What is the CBO Simplifier?</h1>
                    <p>
                        The <strong>CBO Simplifier</strong> is a service which takes <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/cost-estimates">cost reports</a>
                        published by <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/">Congressional Budget Office</a>, and boils them
                        down into a simple revenue-vs-cost form.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This is an example of what <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/publication/52133">a typical CBO report</a> looks like:
                    </p>

                        <p>
                            Enacting S. 2921 would affect several benefit programs administered by the
                            Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), including those providing education,
                            housing, and burial benefits. On net, those changes would decrease direct
                            spending by $3.9 billion over the 2017-2026 period.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In addition, S. 2921 would make a number of changes to VAâ€™s health care
                            programs, including expanding the caregivers program, improving benefits for
                            homeless veterans, and increasing pay for medical staff. In total, CBO estimates
                            that implementing those provisions would cost $3.5 billion over the 2017-2021
                            period, subject to appropriation of the necessary amounts.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Pay-as-you-go procedures apply because enacting the legislation would affect
                            direct spending. Enacting the bill would not affect revenues. CBO estimates that
                            enacting S. 2921 would not increase net direct spending or on-budget deficits in
                            any of the four consecutive 10-year periods beginning in 2027.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            S. 2921 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in
                            the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA) and would not affect the budgets of
                            state, local, or tribal governments.
                        </p>
